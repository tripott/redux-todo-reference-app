## About

This is the react/redux teaching "todos" reference app. Each commit point and associated notes below provide a step by step guide on how to build a todo app with react and redux.

This app was started from https://github.com/tripott/redux-todo-starter-kit.git. I cloned the starter kit, removed git db locally, git init-ed a fresh repo locally, and pushed this new project to https://github.com/tripott/redux-todo-reference-app.git.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo.
- Install dependencies. There's a lot. This will take some time to install.
- Start parcel with the `npm run dev` script and browse to localhost:1234.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tripott/redux-todo-reference-app.git
cd redux-todo-reference-app
npm i
npm run dev
```
